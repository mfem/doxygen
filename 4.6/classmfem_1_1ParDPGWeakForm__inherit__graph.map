Given the variational formulation a(u,v) = b(v), (or A u = b, where &lt;Au,v&gt; = a(u,v)) this class forms the DPG linear system A^T G^&#45;1 A u = A^T G^&#45;1 b This system results from the minimum residual formulation u = argmin_w ||G^&#45;1(b &#45; Aw)||. Here G is a symmetric positive definite matrix resulting from the discretization of the Riesz operator on the test space. Since the test space is broken (discontinuous), G is defined and inverted element&#45;wise and the assembly of the global system is performed in the same manner as the standard FEM method. Note that DPGWeakForm can handle multiple Finite Element spaces. " alt="" coords="20,5,255,37"/>
