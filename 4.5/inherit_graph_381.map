Variational transfer has been shown to have better approximation properties than standard interpolation. This facilities can be used for supporting applications which require the handling of non matching meshes. For instance: General multi&#45;physics problems, fluid structure interaction, or even visualization of average quantities within subvolumes This algorithm allows to perform quadrature in the intersection of elements of two separate and unrelated meshes. It generates quadrature rules in the intersection which allows us to integrate&#45;with to machine precision using the mfem::MortarIntegrator interface. See https://doi.org/10.1137/15M1008361 for and in&#45;depth explanation. At this time curved elements are not supported. " alt="" coords="6,5,261,37"/>
