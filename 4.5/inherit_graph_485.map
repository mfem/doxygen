The number of the node is assigned by counting the nodes from zero as they are pushed into the table. Diagonals of any kind are not allowed so the row, column and floor must all be different for each node. Only one node is stored for all 6 symmetric entries that are indexable by unique triplets of row, column, and floor. " alt="" coords="6,5,186,37"/>
